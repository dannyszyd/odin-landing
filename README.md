# odin-landing
This is the TOP Landing Page Project

Goals:

 - Use what I learned from flex lessons/flex zombies
 to efficiently use flexbox
 - Practice commiting via VSC sync

03/04/22 Notes:

 - Going to have to figure out the
 spacing between sections, consider: 
   - putting flex on body and or making a container with flex around eveyrthing to control

   *AND*:

 - play around with margins/padding (still need to do that for sections, just like the padding in signupt helped keep the button from the edge)

  - Dont stress too hard and over write code, just get the looks down first as I have been doing and then worry about everything's "alignment" afterwards!
  
  YOU GOT THIS!!!!
